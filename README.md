# 📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis with SQL and Power BI

Welcome to my data exploration project where I dive into real-world e-commerce data using **SQL** and bring the insights to life with **Power BI** dashboards. This project aims to extract business intelligence from raw data, answer strategic questions, and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL on an e-commerce dataset, followed by creating **interactive dashboards in Power BI** to visualize key business insights.

I focused on answering the following business questions:

1. **Which shipping modes generate the most revenue?**
2. **Which markets have the highest average shipping costs?**
3. **Which product categories generate the highest average profit?**
4. **How has the profit margin evolved over time?**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **DataWorld** – SQL queries for data exploration
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization
* **GitHub** – Project versioning and documentation
* **CSV Files** – Raw data loaded into the SQL environment

## 🧾 Datasets

The following tables were used:

* `global_sales`: Sales transactions with sales value, shipping cost, and product/customer info
* `global_orders`: Order details with dates, priority, and shipping mode
* `global_products`: Product category and details
* `global_customers`: Customer profile, including region and market

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* **Standard Class** shipping mode generated the highest total sales, suggesting customer preference for cost-effective delivery.
* **APAC** and **US** markets showed higher average shipping costs, pointing to potential supply chain optimizations.
* **Technology** was the most profitable category on average, making it a key driver of business margin.
* **Profit margins** fluctuated throughout the year, likely influenced by promotions and operational costs.

These insights were transformed into a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** with filters, KPIs, and visual breakdowns by market, shipping mode, and time.
